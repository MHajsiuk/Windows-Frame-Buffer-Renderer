# Windows-Frame-Buffer-Renderer
This is the base code for a windows frame buffer renderer

I have created this Visual Studio project for a basic frame buffer renderer unsing MS's WIN32 API. I have been missing the old days of DOS graphics programming where you can simply write a byte to a memory location and it would output to the screen. This project was designed off that idea and is a template to be used for whatever else I want to do in the future with graphics related projects.

Hopefully in the future I will add libraries for basic primative 2D graphic functions like pixel plotting, line drawing, circle etc, and maybe extend to 3D world.
